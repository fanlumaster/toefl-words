## Lesson1

1. The reason I think this painting is so important is that is stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style.

- stress: v 强调；着重
- impressionist: adj 印象派画家
- Rose Frantzen: 她的作品既具有印象派风格又具有现实主义风格

2. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved.

3. You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that is's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism.

按：注意 that 和 than 的读音

4. I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist.

- accessible: adj 容易理解的；易懂的

按：accessible 的开头读音有点像 e。

5. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know a little bit about their life story. But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen' life anyway.

- appreciate: v 欣赏

6. Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It's a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that is stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It's kind of bleak, but you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines. The colors aren's quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural...pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that's the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me. One interesting thing I read about Frantzen is that when she first moved back to lowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn, is was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too.

- fence in 这里读成了 /fen ten/
- an impression 连在一起，起头读成了 any
