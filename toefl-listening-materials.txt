## Lesson1

1. The reason I think this painting is so important is that is stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style.

- stress: v 强调；着重
- impressionist: adj 印象派画家
- Rose Frantzen: 她的作品既具有印象派风格又具有现实主义风格

2. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved.

3. You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that is's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism.

按：注意 that 和 than 的读音

4. I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist.

- accessible: adj 容易理解的；易懂的

按：accessible 的开头读音有点像 e。

5. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know a little bit about their life story. But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen' life anyway.

- appreciate: v 欣赏

6. Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It's a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that is stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It's kind of bleak, but you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines. The colors aren's quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural...pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that's the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me. One interesting thing I read about Frantzen is that when she first moved back to lowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn, is was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too.

- exhibit: n 展览
- right: adv 立即
- bleak: adj 荒凉的
- brushstroke: n 笔触

按：
- want you to 这里的读音很含混
- but 弱读，发 /bət/ 音，but you 连起来的读音是 /bətʃju:/，像波秋
- fence in 这里读成了 /fen ten/
- an impression 连在一起，起头读成了 any

## Lesson2

1. Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is--dating techniques.

- geologic: 地质的
- dating: 年代

2. And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time.

- fairly: 相当地
- flatten out: 逐渐变平

3. The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there.

- 注意这里的 where it mixed in 有两个连读

4. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range.

- Zircon: 锆石

按：
- 这里的 one of the mountain 中的 the 听上去很像 your

5. You know the theory that earth's continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively.

- Uranium: 铀
- Lead: 铅

6. Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon is a material contains radioactive Uranium, whick makes it very useful for dating purposes. Zircon starts off as molten magma, the hot lava from volcanoes. This magma then crystallize. And when Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges. Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your smaple to the age of the Zircon in the mountains. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range. Is enerybody with me on that? Good. So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the smaples was formed at the same time the granite in the Appalachian Mountains was formed. So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we've been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong.
