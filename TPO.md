Roman Cultural Influence on Britain

After the Roman Empire's conquest of Britain in the first century A.D., the presence of administrators, merchants, and troops on British soil, along with the natural flow of ideas and goods from the rest of the empire, had an enormous influence on life in the British Isles. Cultural influences were of three types: the bringing of objects, the transfer of craft workers, and the introduction of massive civil architecture. Many objects were not art in even the broadest sense and comprised utilitarian items of clothing, utensils, and equipment. We should not underestimate the social status associated with such mundane possessions which had not previously been available. The flooding of Britain with red-gloss pottery from Gaul (modern-day France), decorated with scenes from Classical mythology, probably brought many into contact with the styles and artistic concepts of the Greco-Roman world for the first time, whether or not the symbolism was understood. Mass-produced goods were accompanied by fewer more aesthetically impressive objects such as statuettes. Such pieces perhaps first came with officials for their own religious worship; others were then acquired by native leaders as diplomatic gifts or by purchase. Once seen by the natives, such objects created a fashion which rapidly spread through the province.

公元一世纪，罗马帝国征服不列颠后，行政官员、商人和军队在不列颠土地上的存在，以及来自帝国其他地区的思想和商品的自然流动，对不列颠群岛的生活产生了巨大影响。文化影响主要有三种类型：物品的带来、工匠的转移以及大规模的民用建筑的引入。许多物品甚至在最广义的意义上也不算艺术品，包括服装、器皿和设备等实用物品。我们不应低估与此类平凡物品相关联的社会地位，这些物品以前并不易获得。从高卢（今法国）进口的红釉陶器，装饰有古典神话场景，很可能使许多人第一次接触到希腊罗马世界的风格和艺术概念，无论是否理解其中的象征意义。大规模生产的商品伴随着更少但更具审美价值的物品，如小雕像。这些作品可能最初是随着官员进行其自己的宗教崇拜而带来的；其他则被当地领导人作为外交礼物或通过购买获得。一旦被当地人看到，这些物品就会创造出一种时尚，迅速在该地区传播开来。

In the most extreme instances, natives literally bought the whole package of Roman culture. The Fishbourne villa, built in the third quarter of the first century A.D., probably for the native client king Cogidubnus, amply illustrates his Roman pretensions. It was constructed in the latest Italian style with imported marbles and stylish mosaics. It was lavishly furnished with imported sculptures and other Classical objects. A visitor from Rome would have recognized its owner as a participant in the contemporary culture of the empire, not at all provincial in taste. Even if those from the traditional families looked down on him, they would have been unable to dismiss him as uncultured. Although exceptional, this demonstrates how new cultural symbols bound provincials to the identity of the Roman world.

- literally: 真正地，确实地
- villa: 度假别墅
- client: 客户
- amply: 充分地
- pretension: 虚饰；虚夸
- marble: 大理石
- stylish: 时髦的
- mosaic: 马赛克
- lavishly: 大量的
- furnish: 装饰
- contemporary: 属同时期的
- provincial: 外地的；地方上的；外地人

在最极端的情况下，当地人实际上购买了整套罗马文化。 建于公元一世纪第三个季度的菲什本别墅，可能是为当地的客户国王科吉杜布努斯而建，充分展示了他的罗马装扮。 它以最新的意大利风格建造，采用进口大理石和时尚的马赛克。 豪华地配备了进口雕塑和其他古典物品。 一位来自罗马的访客会认出其所有者是当代帝国文化的参与者，完全不会在品味上表现出乡土气息。 即使传统家庭的人看不起他，他们也无法将他视为没有文化。 尽管这种情况很特殊，但它说明了新的文化象征如何将居民与罗马世界的身份联系在一起。

Such examples established a standard to be copied. One result was an influx of craft worker, particularly those skilled in artistic media like stone-carving which had not existed before the conquest. Civilian workers came mostly from Gaul and Germany. The magnificent temple built beside the sacred spring at Bath was constructed only about twenty years after the conquest. Its detail shows that it was carved by artists from northeast Gaul. In the absence of a tradition of Classical stone-carving and building, the desire to develop Roman amenities would have been difficult to fulfill. Administrators thus used their personal contacts to put the Britons in touch with architects and masons. As many of the officials in Britain had strong links with Gaul, it is not surprising that early Roman Britain owes much to craft workers from that area. Local workshops did develop and stylistically similar groups of sculpture show how skills in this new medium became widerspread. Likewise skills in the use of mosaic, wall painting, ceramic decoration, and metal-working developed throughout the province with the eventual emergence of characteristically Romano-British styles.

- influx: 涌入；流入
- carve: 雕刻
- amentity: 生活福利设施；便利设施
- Briton: 英国人
- mason: 石匠；泥瓦匠
- owe: 欠债
- stylistically: 风格上的
- medium: 媒介
- likewise: 类似的
- ceramic: 陶瓷制品
- emergence: 嶄露頭角(来自剑桥词典)
- characteristically: 典型的；独特的；特有的

这些例子确立了可复制的标准。结果之一是手工艺工人的涌入，特别是那些在征服之前不存在的石雕等艺术媒介技术熟练的人。文职工人主要来自高卢和德国。这座宏伟的寺庙建在巴斯圣泉旁，是在征服后大约二十年才建成的。其细节表明它是由高卢东北部的艺术家雕刻的。如果没有古典石雕和建筑的传统，发展罗马设施的愿望就很难实现。因此，管理人员利用他们的个人关系让英国人与建筑师和泥瓦匠取得联系。由于英国的许多官员与高卢有着密切的联系，因此早期罗马不列颠很大程度上得益于该地区的工匠也就不足为奇了。当地的工作室确实开发了风格相似的雕塑组，展示了这种新媒介的技能如何得到更广泛的传播。同样，马赛克、壁画、陶瓷装饰和金属加工的使用技能在全省得到发展，最终出现了典型的罗马-英国风格。

This art had a major impact on the native peoples, and one of the most important factors was a change in the scale of buildings. Pre-Roman Britain was highly localized, with people rarely traveling beyond their own region. On occasion large groups amassed for war or religious festivals, but society remained centered on small communities. Architecture of this era reflected this with even the largest of the fortified towns and hill forts containing no more than clusters of medium-sized structures. The spaces inside even the largest roundhouses were modest, and the use of rounded shapes and organic building materials gave buildings a human scale. But the effect of Roman civil architecture was significant. The sheer size of space enclosed within buildings like the basilica of London must have been astonishing. This was an architecture of dominance in which subject peoples were literally made to feel small by buildings that epitomized imperial power. Supremacy was accentuated by the unyielding straight lines of both individual buildings and planned settlements since these too provided a marked contrast with the natural curvilinear shapes dominant in the native realm.

- on occasion: 偶尔
- amass: (尤指大量)积累，积聚
- fortify: 筑城防御
- fort: 要塞
- cluster: 簇
- roundhouse: 圆形房屋(可能)
- organic: 有机的
- sheer size: 宏大规模
- enclose: 把……围起来
- basilica: 会堂
- astonishing: 令人十分惊讶的
- dominance: 占支配地位
- epitomized: 成为……的典范
- imperial: 帝国的；皇帝的
- supremacy: 最大权力
- accentuate: 着重；强调
- unyielding: 坚定的
- curvilinear: 曲线的
- dominant: 占主导地位
- realm: 领域；场所


这种艺术对当地人民产生了重大影响，其中最重要的因素之一是建筑规模的变化。罗马入侵之前的不列颠地区高度局部化，人们很少超出自己的地区旅行。偶尔会有大规模集结的战争或宗教节日，但社会仍然以小型社区为中心。这个时代的建筑反映了这一点，即使是最大的要塞城镇和山岭堡垒也仅包含一些中等规模的建筑群。即使是最大的圆形房屋内部的空间也是适度的，而圆形形状和有机建筑材料的使用使建筑物具有人类的尺度感。但罗马民用建筑的影响是显著的。像伦敦大教堂这样的建筑所围合的空间之巨大必定是令人惊讶的。这是一种主导性的建筑，通过代表帝国权力的建筑使臣民感到渺小。统治地位由于个别建筑和计划定居点的不可动摇的直线，而突显出来，因为这些也与在当地领域中占主导地位的自然曲线形状形成了鲜明对比。
